# Marketing & Launch Guide

Follow this guide to get your first 1,000 visitors.

## 1. Setup Analytics (Crucial)
You need to know who is visiting.
1.  Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com/).
2.  Create a property for `Client Converts`.
3.  Get your **Measurement ID** (starts with `G-`).
4.  Open `index.html` (and all tool `index.html` files) in your code.
5.  Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual ID.
6.  Push the changes to GitHub.

## 2. Google Search Console (SEO)
Tell Google you exist.
1.  Go to [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
2.  Add a property: `URL prefix` -> `https://sepemmers.github.io/client-converts/`.
3.  Verify ownership (HTML tag method is easiest, or since you have GA4, it might auto-verify).
4.  **Submit Sitemap**: Go to "Sitemaps" on the left and enter `sitemap.xml`.

## 3. The "Free Tool" Launch Strategy
Since your tools are free, secure, and client-side, they are highly shareable.

### A. Reddit
Post in these subreddits (be honest, say "I built this"):
*   r/webdev (Showoff Saturday)
*   r/InternetIsBeautiful
*   r/SideProject
*   r/software
*   r/privacytools (Highlight the "Client-Side / No Upload" aspect)

**Sample Title**: "I built a free, privacy-focused alternative to those spammy PDF/Image converter sites. Runs 100% in browser."

### B. Hacker News
*   Submit to [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/submit).
*   Title: "Show HN: Client Converts – Local-only PDF and Image tools"

### C. Product Hunt
*   Create a nice listing.
*   Use the screenshots we generated (or take new ones).
*   Emphasize: "No Signup", "No Server Uploads", "Free Forever".

## 4. Ongoing
*   **Add "Share" buttons**: Consider adding Twitter/LinkedIn share buttons to the tool pages.
*   **Blog**: If you have a blog, write about "Why client-side tools are safer".
